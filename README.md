Malware Detection Using Supervised ML

In this project supervised machine learning is used for malware detection in the system.
Primary data has been used for this project. Dynamic malware analysis is performed,
where malware is analyzed after executing it in the malware analysis lab. Flare VM on
Windows 10 distribution is used as the sandbox. The log files are obtained by running
both malware and goodware on Flare vm. Data is extracted from these log files using an
NLP technique called bag of words and labeled afterward. This is followed by model
training and evaluation. RandomForest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and SVM are
the four different algorithms which were used to train the model. Among them, Random
Forest gave the highest accuracy of 99.99806%
